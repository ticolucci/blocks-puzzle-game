## 4. Bonus points when the grid gets completely empty
When the user puts a piece that clears all existing blocks, the user gets bonus points.

## 5. Give points per placed piece
Instead of giving points only when pieces are cleared, give points for every piece placed on the board based on the number of blocks in the piece - 10 per block.
